# SmallSteps
SmallSteps Foundation Website

This Website was created through HTML, JavaScript, and CSS and displays information for the SmallSteps Nonprofit Foundation. 
Inspiration for themes was taken from Wordpress.com and Dreamweaver IDE was used to create the website. 
Some Challenges were getting the website to look properly visually appealing and some HTML kinks, like getting the dropdown 
to appear in infront of the rest of the page. In the future, ReactNative could be used to apply this to be accessible through a phone application.

To run, download the folder, with all files and images, and open the HTML file in google.
